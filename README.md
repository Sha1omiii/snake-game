# Snake Game
![Snake Game Image](snakeGame.png 'Simple snake game') 

This is a simple snake game in which the player controls a *developing line* that resembles a snake with the arrow keys on the computer. The goal is to avoid clashing with the *wall* and the *snake's own body* as it grows longer. This is a single-player variant in which the snake grows longer with each egg consumed. 

## Background 
The ***1976 Gremlin Industries*** two-player arcade video game **Blockade** served as the inspiration for the snake game. To live longer than the other player was the aim of **Blockade**. With time, the idea developed into a *single-player* version in which a snake—typically represented by apples or eggs—grows longer with each bite of food consumed. The game has undergone numerous platform and version adaptations and has grown to become a classic.

> I chose this game because, even though I've played it over a thousand times, it seemed like a project that would allow me to learn new things about making things and expand my knowledge of coding. 

## Getting Started
I spent some time thinking through how a player would want to play the game before I began writing the user stories and the pseudocode because I was already familiar with the basic idea of how to play the snake game. Most of it was really simple, but I did have to learn some new ideas like canvas and how to use javascript to change the contents inside of them, which was exciting and engaging. I've included links to both my deployed game and my pseudocode so you can see how I created it.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML & CSS**: to structure and style the layout of the landing page
* **Javascript**: to add the necessary interactions needed for the snake game to work.

# Coming Soon
* An audio system that plays everytime the snake collides with the apple 
* A different sound that plays when the snake collided with itself or the wall
* Adding more obstacles like rocks
* Power ups and extra points 
* Adding a two-player mode.
